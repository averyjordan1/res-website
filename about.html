            <p class="about-us indent"> As an umbrella organization that brings together
                sustainably-minded students and administrators, the
                Rice Environmental Society facilitates collaboration
                among existing groups in order to promote
                environmentalism in all aspects of student life. </p>

            <div>
                <p class="about-us-title">Our official mission</p>
            </div>
            <p class="about-us indent"> Over time, Rice University has seen an increase in the number and
                variety of environmental and sustainability-focused groups on campus. As Rice celebrated its centennial
                anniversary, a document was passed through the Rice Student Association called the
                100-Year-Sustainability Plan. To further the efforts set forth in the 100-Year Plan,
                we believe it is necessary to provide a channel for students to get involved while promoting
                interactions between the individual groups. We also recognize that sustainable initiatives require
                additional funding. Therefore, it is our mission to give students, faculty, and administrators a
                central name and website to find information about the environmental groups on campus and their
                initiatives. It is also our mission to generate and provide funding for the environmental groups and
                environmentally minded individuals to draw from in their sustainable efforts.</p>
