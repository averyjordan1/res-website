           </div>
           <p class="conference-description indent"> RES is hosting a sustainability conference on
        February 4th, 2017. The conference is centered around
        the theme of "Cities and Sustainability." Undergraduate and graduate students, as well as Rice faculty,
        are welcome to attend the RES conference. The conference is divided into two portions: (1) networking
        with sustainable employers and (2) research presentations from Rice faculty and students. RES wants this
        conference to serve as a focal point for sustainable discussion and action on Rice's campus and in the
        Houston community. We also want students to be aware of the opportunities for sustainable employment
        that exist in Houston and around the country.</p>
       <p class="conference-description indent">The conference lasts from 10:30am - 4:30pm, and includes breakfast, coffee
       and lunch from Pat Greer's Kitchen. All registered attendees will receive a t-shirt and a conference bag. Some of
       our speakers include: <em>Dylan Dickens, Monica Charletta, Geneva Vest, and Rives Taylor.</em> Additionally,
       company representatives from groups such as <em>MP2 Energy, Cleanline Energy Partners, Urban Harvest,
           and the Hermann Park Conservancy</em> will be attending to network with participants.</p>
